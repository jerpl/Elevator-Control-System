# Elevator-Control-System
This project simulates an apartment building's control system, featuring an elevator control system with multiple pathfinding algorithms to optimize route prioritization and decrease wait time. Including two elevators communicating with one another to logically determine which passengers should be assigned to each elevator, and the ability to update assignments based on new incoming requests. Alongside this, I integrated security systems to handle emergencies such as fires, power outages, and threats to elevator passengers, with integrated emergency handling protocols to overwrite the standard pathfinding algorithms. I worked through the complete design process, including use cases, sequence and UML class diagrams, and an interface to represent interaction from the inside and outside of the elevators.
